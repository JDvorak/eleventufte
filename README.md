# Eleventufte

Years back, a team of dedicated obsessives created [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), CSS library and Webfont package meant to duplicate the look and feel of Edward Tufte's much-loved books. The related [tufte-markdown](https://github.com/luhmann/tufte-markdown) project, in turn, was created to parse (mostly) standard Markdown into the idiosyncratic markup needed to make Tufte's styling sing.

Which brings us to [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), a slick static site generator that's lightweight and customizable where others are crunky and set in their ways. By swapping `tufte-markdown` for Eleventy's default markdown parser and slapping the `tufte-css` styles into a (fairly) vanilla setup, we can stand up a Tufte-like blogging experience in no time flat.

Give it a shot, nerds.
